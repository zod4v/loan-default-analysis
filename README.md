🚀 Just completed a new Data Analytics Project! 💻📊

I'm excited to share a Power BI dashboard project I recently worked on, focused on Loan Default Data Analysis.

🔍 Project Highlights:
✅ Used SQL Server as the primary data source
✅ Cleaned and queried large datasets to extract key insights
✅ Built a dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard
✅ Analyzed patterns in loan defaults, identifying trends based on credit history, income, loan amount, and more

📈 The goal was to uncover actionable insights that could help financial institutions reduce risk and improve lending strategies.

🔧 Tools Used:

SQL Server for data extraction and transformation

Power BI for data modeling, visualization & dashboard design

💡 This project deepened my understanding of data storytelling and how impactful visual insights can drive better decisions in finance.

Would love to hear your thoughts and feedback! 😊
